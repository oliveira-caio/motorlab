# motorlab
this package contains all the tools i've used and all the experiments i've tried so far in my phd project.

# to do
- add a nondeterministic dataset by selecting the starting points of the sequences randomly.
- figure out a good way to train models with sequences of varying length.
- add early stop such that, if the main metric doesn't improve in 50 iterations, it stops.
- implement load function per session and make all load functions use it.
